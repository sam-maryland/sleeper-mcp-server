# Sleeper MCP Server - Project Vision & Requirements

## Project Overview

We are building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI agents to the Sleeper Fantasy Football API. This will allow AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools to analyze fantasy football data, provide insights, and help with league management tasks.

## Vision Statement

Create a comprehensive MCP server that transforms how fantasy football players interact with their league data by enabling AI agents to:
- Provide intelligent roster analysis and recommendations
- Generate trade suggestions and fairness evaluations  
- Offer real-time insights on player trends and matchups
- Automate routine league management tasks
- Create engaging league summaries and reports

## Target Users

1. **Fantasy Football Players** - Want AI-powered insights for roster decisions
2. **League Commissioners** - Need tools for league management and analysis
3. **Content Creators** - Seeking automated league recaps and analysis
4. **Developers** - Want to integrate fantasy football data into their AI workflows

## Core Value Propositions

### For Players
- **Smart Roster Decisions**: AI analysis of start/sit decisions based on matchups
- **Trade Intelligence**: Evaluate trade proposals and find optimal trade partners
- **Waiver Wire Insights**: Identify trending players and sleeper picks
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed analysis of team and player performance

### For Commissioners
- **League Health Monitoring**: Track engagement, identify inactive teams
- **Trade Oversight**: Automated fairness analysis for disputed trades
- **Content Generation**: Weekly league summaries and standings reports
- **Historical Analysis**: Season-long trends and league statistics

### For Developers
